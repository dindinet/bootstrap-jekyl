SEO-description: Disaster or Delight. Vote Remain. We can only influence Europe by leading from within.

My fellow European UK Â Citizens. The campaign has focused on a battle between opposing factions of the Conservative party. Neither of these factions is interested in helping the ordinary working people of the UK.

The current climate of mass movement of people throughout the world and the slow recovery after the financial crisis have allowed the Vote Leave campaign to play on peoples fears using the EU as a scapegoat. The Eu did not create the conditions around the world that lead to migration and the EU did not cause the financial crisis.

We can only influence Europe by leading from within.![Holy Rich Pig](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZjKfq8vWX1VA95lpz92zzxxmzg3nkBJkzmJwp1x2Lt1OBWuXQtUpdQpdunHpuJ_Fr8U9CSqFPw4YUhkQPj4=s750-rw-v2-e10-t.webp)
